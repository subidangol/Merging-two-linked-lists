# Merging-two-linked-lists

This program implements an ordered list abstract data type in a class with a linked list, and it uses that class in a program that orders two groups of integers, each group in its own list, and then merges them into one ordered list.

This is a C++ program that reads two sets of integers from two files and stores them in two lists, in ascending order.
The values in the input files may be in any order. Values that appear in an input file more than once are recorded in the corresponding list only once. The program will report the values in the two lists, in order, and how many there are in each list.

The program then merges the two ordered lists into one new list, in which no value is duplicated and all the values are in ascending order. The program writes the values in this new list to the terminal, along with the number of values in the merged list.
